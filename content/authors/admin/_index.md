Biological systems are complex. We do have a fair amount of information on the individual components that build them up, from the molecules in a cell to the species in an ecosystem, yet it remains unclear how their assembly results in emergent behaviors. Novel technologies have made it possible to easily retrieve large amounts of data, but there is a long way from there to unveiling the first principles of life.

My research focuses on communities of cells that have either *genetic* differences (e.g. bacterial colonies where various strains coexist), *phenotypic* differences (e.g. tissues where all cells have the same DNA sequence but still display variability in size, morphology or activity), or both. Their composition, as well as the interactions between their individuals, determine their properties. Is it possible to understand, predict and ultimately act on how these communities assemble and evolve?

To address these questions, I use mathematical modeling, computer simulations and data analyses that complement the experimental skills that I (slowly but steadily!) keep developing. I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, where I work with professor [Ramón Díaz-Uriarte](https://www.ligarto.org/rdiaz/) on cancer evolution. Soon I will be joining the [Sánchez Laboratory](http://www.sanchezlaboratory.com/) at Yale. Stay tuned!!
