I am an incoming "Ramon y Cajal" Group Leader at the [Institute of Functional Biology and Genomics](https://ibfg.usal-csic.es/index-en.php) of the [University of Salamanca](https://www.usal.es/), after completing my post- and pre-doctoral training at the [Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Yale University](https://https://eeb.yale.edu/) and the [Spanish National Center for Biotechnology]().

I am broadly interested in the fields of systems biology, evolutionary genetics, and microbial ecology. Most recently, my work has aimed to develop mathematical frameworks to model interactions between biological components, from genes within a genome to species within an ecosystem. I use a combination of experimental, theoretical, and computational methods to address fundamental questions on how populations and communities of (micro)organisms evolve, respond to perturbations, and carry out biotechnologically-relevant functions.
