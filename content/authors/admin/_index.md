I am currently a postdoctoral scientist working in the [Institute of Functional Biology and Genomics](https://ibfg.usal-csic.es/index-en.php) at the [University of Salamanca](https://www.usal.es/), where I recently moved from the [Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Yale University](https://https://eeb.yale.edu/). I am a part of the [Evolution of Community Function lab](https://sanchezlaboratory.weebly.com/) led by Alvaro Sanchez.

My research encompasses the interdisciplinary fields of ecology, evolutionary genetics, and systems biology, with a strong quantitative focus combining experimental, theoretical, and computational methods. Most recently, my work has aimed to **predictively link the species-level composition with the functions of ecological communities**. The goal is to understand how community-level functions emerge from complex, multi-scale interactions between member species. Ultimately, I seek to develop practical guidelines for the rational design of ecological communities that can optimize a wide variety of functions, from the degradation of environmental pollutants to the fertilization of agricultural soils.
