I am currently a postdoctoral scientist at the [Spanish National Center for Biotechnology](https://www.cnb.csic.es/index.php/en) (CNB-CSIC), where I recently moved from the [Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Yale University](https://https://eeb.yale.edu/). I am a part of the [Evolution of Community Function lab](https://sanchezlaboratory.weebly.com/) led by Alvaro Sanchez.

My work encompasses the interdisciplinary fields of ecology, evolutionary genetics, and systems biology, with a strong quantitative focus combining experimental, theoretical, and computational methods. Most recently, my focus has been **predictively linking the species-level composition with the functions of ecological communities**. My aim is to understand how community-level functions emerge from the complex interactions between member species. Ultimately, my goal is to develop practical guidelines for the rational design of ecological communities that can optimize a wide variety of functions, from the degradation of environmental pollutants to the fertilization of agricultural soils.
