I recently came across [this very cool preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.22.055517v1) in which Sarah P. Hammarlund et al. address the question of how several mutualistic parters are maintained in mutualistic networks despite them competing for the same resources. There are quite a few intriguing ideas in this paper. Let's start from the beginning...

## Mutualism(s)?

Straight out of [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutualism_(biology)):
> Mutualism describes the ecological interaction between two or more species where each species has a net benefit.
Perhaps the most typical example are bees and flowering plants. Bees feed on the flowers' nectar and carry pollen around: everybody wins!

Sometimes sets of more than two species can form _mutualistic networks_. Think of it as flowers being pollinated by both bees and butterflies (I'm using the exact same analogy as in the paper, but I feel like it really is _the_ analogy).

- What is a "mutualism"? What are "mutualistic networks"?
- Classic ecology would predict exclusion if >1 species compete for an only resource (highest fitness/growth rate wins), so mutualistic _networks_ shouldn't exist

- Paper way of assessing coexistence
