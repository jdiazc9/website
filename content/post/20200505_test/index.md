I recently came across [this very cool preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.22.055517v1) in which Sarah P. Hammarlund et al. address the question of how several mutualistic parters are maintained in mutualistic networks despite them competing for the same resources. There are quite a few intriguing things that got me thinking. Let's start from the beginning...

- What is a "mutualism"? What are "mutualistic networks"?
- Classic ecology would predict exclusion if >1 species compete for an only resource (highest fitness/growth rate wins), so mutualistic _networks_ shouldn't exist
- Paper results
- Paper way of assessing coexistence
