abstract: Directed evolution has been used for decades to engineer biological systems
  from the top-down. Generally, it has been applied at or below the organismal level,
  by iteratively sampling the mutational landscape in a guided search for genetic
  variants of higher function. Above the organismal level, a small number of studies
  have attempted to artificially select microbial communities and ecosystems, with
  uneven and generally modest success. Our theoretical understanding of artificial
  ecosystem selection is still limited, particularly for large assemblages of asexual
  organisms, and we know little about designing efficient methods to direct their
  evolution. To address this issue, we have developed a flexible modeling framework
  that allows us to systematically probe any arbitrary selection strategy on any arbitrary
  set of communities and selected functions, in a wide range of ecological conditions.
  By artificially selecting hundreds of in-silico microbial metacommunities under
  identical conditions, we examine the fundamental limits of the two main breeding
  methods used so far, and prescribe modifications that significantly increase their
  power. We identify a range of directed evolution strategies that, particularly when
  applied in combination, are better suited for the top-down engineering of large,
  diverse, and stable microbial consortia. Our results emphasize that directed evolution
  allows an ecological structure-function landscape to be navigated in search for
  dynamically stable and ecologically and functionally resilient high-functioning
  communities.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.
